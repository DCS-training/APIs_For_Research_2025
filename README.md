# Setup instructions (support available in session) - Required at session 2 
Further information will be provided on the day

### 1. Noteable

If you are part of the University of Edinburgh you can use [Noteable](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/) the cloud-based computational notebook system which works on your browser from any device.

#### Start Noteable (Python-based)
1.  Open the following link in a new tab:  [https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login)
2.  Login with your EASE credentials
3.  Under 'Standard Python 3 Notebook' click 'Start'

#### Upload the Notebook (and files) to Noteable (for Python users)
1.  From the Noteable home page, click on the 'Git'>'Clone a Repository' button at the top bar of the screen and enter the link of this repo [LINK](LINK)
2.  Now click on Clone
3.  You now have imported the full repo and you can see all the material
4.  Double-click on '01_API_Codebook_GettingStarted.ipynb' to open the Notebook
5.  Follow the instruction on the Notebook

> Noteable is the recommended mode for University members since your EASE credentials provide easy access to the analysis and avoid further installation of any software or tools locally.
> For intermeddiate candidates familar with programming, running the notebook locally would allow for a better controlled environment.
